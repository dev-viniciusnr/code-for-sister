# Code for Sister

This repository contains a small school exercise that I wrote to help my sister with an assignment for her mechatronics course.  
At the time, I had no prior experience with the language used, so this was a quick learning experience focused on solving a specific problem with logic and improvisation.

The goal was simply to deliver a working solution in time for her to complete the assignment â€” a fun and spontaneous moment in my journey as a developer.
